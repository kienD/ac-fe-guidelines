# AC Frontend Formatting Guidelines

This repo is a styling guide for frontend code on the AC project.  Most of our styling rules are handled by eslint & prettier; those that aren't should be here.

We follow most of the same formatting rules outlined in the [Liferay Frontend Guidelines](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-frontend-guidelines) repo but there are some differences.
