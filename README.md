# AC Frontend Formatting Guidelines

This repo is a styling guide for frontend code on the AC project.  Most of our styling rules are handled by eslint & prettier; those that aren't should be here.


Our project generally adheres to the [Liferay Frontend Guidelines](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-frontend-guidelines/tree/master/general) but there are some differences.



- [Javascript|Typescript](./javascript.md)
- [CSS](./css.md)
